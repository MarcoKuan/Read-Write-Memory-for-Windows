# Read/Write Process Memory for Windows

A terminal project that was made using "[Rust for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs)". This program will run a terminal and ask to enter a PID and then ask if the user would like to read/write to the program's address, as well as how many bytes. This is a work in progress and it is prone to many bugs.
